# Notes on Vijay Boyapati's *The Bullish Case for Bitcoin*

Some ideas to consider. Things to add, things to subtract, other changes I would suggest making.

The format for my notes is as follows:

## Prologue

> Yet for business to be conducted, money is required. Money is the most important good in any developed economy because it acts as the foundation for all trade and savings. Gold, the ancient and venerable precious metal, had served this role for millennia, but its physicality was an Achilles' heel ...

The part of me that has read and appreciated Rothbard's *What Has Government Done etc.* and Szabo's "Shelling Out" essay would like to see just a sentence here just mentioning that many things have served as money in human history before gold won its position as the best money given available technology. You explain this in greater detail once we get to Chapter 1, but I think just a mention here is a good idea.
