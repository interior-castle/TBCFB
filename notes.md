# Notes on Vijay Boyapati's *The Bullish Case for Bitcoin*

Some ideas to consider. Things to add, things to subtract, other changes I would suggest making.

The format for my notes is as follows:

## Prologue

### The Gordian Knot

> Yet for business to be conducted, money is required. Money is the most important good in any developed economy because it acts as the foundation for all trade and savings. Gold, the ancient and venerable precious metal, had served this role for millennia, but its physicality was an Achilles' heel ...

The part of me that has read and appreciated Rothbard's *What Has Government Done to Our Money* and Szabo's "Shelling Out" essay would like to see just a sentence here just mentioning that many things have served as money in human history before gold won its position as the best money given available technology. You explain this once we get to Chapter 1, but I think just a mention here is a good idea.

> With a desire to facilitate anonymous payments and to overcome the vulnerabilities of gold, cypherpunks hoped to develop a digital currency that would be immune to the coercive power of the state.
> 
> In 1983, American computer scientist David Chaum published a design for eCash [...]

Between these sentences, I think it would be good to have a single sentence listing the characteristics that a digital currency would have to have. "Such a currency would need to be secure, scarce, decentralized, fungible, and unforgeable." (This is the order of properties that you go through in the next few paragraphs where you recount the history of attempts to create digital currencies.)

> With the market capitalization of Bitcoin surpassing a trillion dollars

Might want to rephrase the beginning of this paragraph to future-proof it. "Trillions" would probably do it, at least until we 100x :)

> and whose price rise has prompted some to compare it to the tulip mania or the dot-com bubble

You might want to name also the skeptics who say they have missed the boat, that it's too late. I.e., that it was only a good investment back when it was in the tens or hundreds of dollars, but now there aren't sufficiently attractive gains to be had.
